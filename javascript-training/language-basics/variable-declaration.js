// How to store data in JavaScript?

// Syntax : Declaration Variable = Data ;

// Declaration is all about specifying the nature of the data by using a set of keywords in JavaScript.

// In JavaScript, we can declare the variables by using three different keywords.

// 1.var /empty (We should avoid) => var will be used to store the data which can be changed any time
// 2. let => let will be used to store the data which can be changed any time, but it has block scope(inside brackets).
// 3. const => const will be used to store the data which cannot be changed later

// all follows below 4 rules
//1. Initialization
//2. Reassignment
//3.Redeclaration
//4.Scope of the data


//1. Initialization

// Initialization is all about adding the value at the time of declaring, that is , storing the data while creating the variable itself.

var a ; //It is not mandatory to initialize the variable when we are declaring with 'var'.
let b ; //It is not mandatory to initialize the variable when we are declaring with 'let'.
const pi = 3.14 ; //It is mandatory to initialize the variable when we are going to declare it with a 'const'.


//2. Reassignment

//Reassignment is all about modifying the original value during the execution process.
a = 100; // Reassignment is possible with the variable declared with 'var'.
b = 200; // Reassignment is possible with the variable declared with 'let'.
// pi = 3.15; //Reassignment is not possible with the variable declared with 'const'.



//3.Redeclartion

//Declaring the variable once again to store different data
var a = "Bharath"; //Redeclaration is possible with the variable declared with 'var'.
//let b = "Sarath"; //Redeclaration is not possible with the variable declared with 'let'.
//const pi = 500; //Redeclaration is not possible with the variable declared with 'const'.



console.log(a);
console.log(b);
console.log(pi);



//4.Scope of the data

// Once we are going to store tha data, where can we access this data?

// When we declare the variable with either 'let' or 'const' , it will act like a block-scoped variable.
// When we declare the variable with 'var' , it will act like a non-block-scoped variable.


{
    var x = 100;
    let y = 200;
    const z = 300;

    // console.log(x);
    // console.log(y);
    // console.log(z);

}

    console.log(x); // This will work because 'x' is not block-scoped.
    console.log(y); // This will throw an error because 'y' is block-scoped.
    console.log(z); // This will throw an error because 'z' is block-scoped.
